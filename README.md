## ExperimentalEMG
Exploratory application fields of GRV-EMG sensors for an interactive human-computer interface created for the subject "Advanced Human-Machine-Interaction" at Aalen University.

### Overall goals of the project
The goal of the project is to use an Arduino microcontroller equipped with an AD8232 module to detect muscle activity of a person/user.
If the user flexes the specific muscle which the electrode patches of the AD8232 are attached to, there should be an input sent to the computer
which the microcontroller is connected to.
This should enable the user to communicate with the computer for different purposes, like testing reaction time, mind-muscle-coordination or even playing games.
